# Juke Platform

Juke is a music intelligence platform that unifies catalog ingestion, playback control, and recommendation orchestration behind a single backend. It ships with a React-based analyst console, native mobile clients, and a Power Hour companion app (ShotClock) that builds on the same APIs.

Backend services live under `backend/`, the analyst console sits in `web/`, and platform-specific mobile clients live under `mobile/`.

See `AGENTS.md` for repo-specific agent guidance and per-subproject notes.

## What ships here

- **Core API**: Django + DRF, OAuth integrations, playlist/recommendation orchestration, and background jobs.
- **Recommender engine**: FastAPI service for embedding lookup and similarity ranking.
- **Analyst console**: React + Vite front end for operators to manage catalog data and run sessions.
- **Mobile clients**: Native iOS + Android apps (Juke) for end users.
- **ShotClock (Power Hour)**: iOS app that layers a timed social game on top of Juke playlists.

## Repository layout

- `backend/`: Django API, Celery workers/beat, recommender engine, infrastructure Dockerfiles, and backend-specific configuration such as `setup.cfg` and `genres.txt`.
- `web/`: Vite + React frontend for analysts.
- `mobile/`: Native clients (`mobile/android/juke`, `mobile/ios/juke`).
- `template.env` and `.env`: stay at the repository root so both Docker Compose files can source them regardless of where services run.
- `backend/static/` (cover art + other media) and `scripts/`: shared assets that remain addressable from the repository root.

## Running the stack

1. Duplicate `template.env` into `.env` (both stay in the repo root) and populate the secrets as needed, including `BACKEND_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and the per-service port variables (`BACKEND_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`, `RECOMMENDER_PORT`, `REDIS_PORT`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `EMAIL_PORT`).
2. Start the local services, including the asynchronous workers and web container:

	 ```bash
	 docker-compose up --build
	 ```

	 The Django API, Celery broker, recommender ML engine, and web console URLs all come from `.env` so you can run multiple stacks without collisions.

### Background tasks

- Celery powers asynchronous workloads (Redis is provisioned automatically in `docker-compose.yml`).
- The default worker plus a beat scheduler are part of the compose stack; for ad-hoc runs use:

	```bash
	docker-compose run --rm worker celery -A settings.celery worker -l info
	```

- Tasks may be triggered via the API (see the genre sync endpoint) or scheduled via Celery Beat.
- The FastAPI-based `recommender-engine` container exposes `/embed` and `/recommend` for computing taste embeddings and likeness scores; Django calls it via the internal Docker network.

## Frontend development

- The React application resides in `web/` with Vite + TypeScript.
- To run the app outside of Docker:

	```bash
	cd web
	npm install
	npm run dev
	```

	You can override the backend target via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

- Asset builds honor `JUKE_RUNTIME_ENV` (`development`, `staging`, `production`). Use `npm run build:dev`, `npm run build:staging`, or `npm run build:prod` to emit the correct bundle; the default `npm run build` targets production and now outputs pre-compressed Brotli/Gzip assets ready for staging or production servers.
- The Dockerized frontend follows the same flag: `development` keeps the Vite dev server live (no bundling), while `staging`/`production` trigger the optimized build and serve the static assets through NGINX (including gzip precompression and `/api` + `/auth` proxying).

## Git hooks

Run the setup script once per clone to enable repo-tracked hooks (includes web lint on commit):

```sh
scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

- Storybook documents the UI kit living under `web/src/uikit`. Launch it with:

	```bash
	cd web
	npm run storybook
	```

	The builder runs on the port configured in Storybook settings.

## Mobile app

- Platform projects now live in `mobile/<platform>/<project>` to make room for future apps (for example, `mobile/android/juke` and `mobile/ios/juke`).
- Open the iOS app with Xcode via `xed mobile/ios/juke/juke-iOS.xcodeproj`.
- Use the existing `juke-iOS` scheme for running on simulators or devices; it continues to build against the same bundle identifiers.

## Tests

- Backend: `docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test` (run `cd backend` first if you prefer executing management commands on the host machine instead of Docker).
- Frontend: `cd web && npm test`

GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs linting plus both suites on every push and pull request targeting `main`.
